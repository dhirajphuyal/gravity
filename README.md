# Gravity - Custom Interpreted Language

Gravity is a new programming language that is currently being developed from scratch with the intention of providing a simple and easy-to-learn syntax for beginners who are just starting to delve into the world of programming. The language is designed to be both intuitive and beginner-friendly, making it accessible to individuals who have little to no experience in the field.

One of the core tenets of Gravity is simplicity. The language is designed to be easy to read and write, with a clear and concise syntax that reduces the number of programming concepts that beginners need to learn. This streamlined approach is particularly beneficial for new programmers, as it allows them to focus on the core concepts of programming without becoming bogged down in complex syntax or other difficult-to-understand elements.
